## Automating Claude Desktop (com.anthropic.claudefordesktop)

This document outlines key findings and strategies for automating the Claude desktop application using AppleScript and the `ax` accessibility helper tool.

**Bundle Identifier:** `com.anthropic.claudefordesktop`

### 1. Ensuring a Clean Application State

It's recommended to quit and relaunch the Claude application before starting an automation sequence to ensure it's in a known, default state.

**AppleScript to Relaunch Claude:**
```applescript
set claudeBundleID to "com.anthropic.claudefordesktop"

-- Quit the application
try
    tell application id claudeBundleID
        if it is running then
            quit
            delay 1 -- Give it a moment to quit
        end if
    end tell
on error errMsg
    log "Notice: Error during quit (or app not running): " & errMsg
end try

-- Ensure it's fully quit
set maxAttempts to 5
repeat maxAttempts times
    if application id claudeBundleID is running then
        delay 0.5
    else
        exit repeat
    end if
end repeat

-- Relaunch the application
try
    tell application id claudeBundleID
        launch
        delay 1 -- Give it a moment to launch
        activate -- Bring to front
    end tell
    log "Claude app relaunched successfully."
on error errMsg
    log "Error: Could not relaunch Claude: " & errMsg
end try
```

### 2. Text Input

Directly setting the `AXValue` of the main text input area via `ax` or simple AppleScript `set value of text area ...` has proven unreliable. The most robust method found is using AppleScript to simulate keystrokes.

**AppleScript for Text Input (after app is active and window is frontmost):**
```applescript
tell application id "com.anthropic.claudefordesktop"
    activate
end tell
delay 0.5 -- Give time for activation

tell application "System Events"
    tell process "Claude" -- Using name, but app should be frontmost by bundle ID
        set frontmost to true
        delay 0.2
        if not (exists window 1) then
            error "Claude window 1 not found after activation."
        end if
        
        -- Optional: Try to explicitly focus the window
        try
            perform action "AXRaise" of window 1
            set focused of window 1 to true
            delay 0.2
        on error
            -- Non-critical if this fails
        end try

        try
            keystroke "Your text to input here."
            log "Keystroke successful."
        on error errMsg number errNum
            error "Error during keystroke: " & errMsg & " (Num: " & errNum & ")"
        end try
    end tell
end tell
```

### 3. Identifying UI Elements with `ax`

The Claude desktop application appears to be Electron-based, meaning UI elements are often nested within web areas.

**a. Main Text Input Area:**
*   **Role:** `AXTextArea`
*   **Location:** Typically within the first window (`window[1]`). The full accessibility path can be quite deep (e.g., `window[1]/group[1]/group[1]/group[1]/group[1]/webArea[1]/group[1]/textArea[1]`).
*   **`ax` Locator (Query):**
    ```json
    {
        "cmd": "query",
        "locator": {
            "app": "com.anthropic.claudefordesktop",
            "pathHint": ["window[1]"], // Start search within the first window
            "role": "AXTextArea"
        },
        "attributes": ["AXValue", "AXFocused", "AXPathHint"],
        "debug_logging": true
    }
    ```
    Querying this after text input can verify the content of `AXValue`.

**b. Send Message Button:**
*   **Role:** `AXButton`
*   **Identifying Attribute:** `AXTitle` is typically "Send message".
*   **Location:** Also within `window[1]`.
*   **`ax` Locator (Query to find):**
    ```json
    {
        "cmd": "query",
        "locator": {
            "app": "com.anthropic.claudefordesktop",
            "pathHint": ["window[1]"],
            "role": "AXButton",
            "title": "Send message" // Key for finding the correct button
        },
        "attributes": ["AXTitle", "AXIdentifier", "AXRoleDescription", "AXPathHint", "AXEnabled", "AXActionNames"],
        "debug_logging": true
    }
    ```
*   **`ax` Locator (Perform Action):**
    ```json
    {
        "cmd": "perform",
        "locator": {
            "app": "com.anthropic.claudefordesktop",
            "pathHint": ["window[1]"],
            "role": "AXButton",
            "title": "Send message"
        },
        "action": "AXPress",
        "debug_logging": true
    }
    ```

### 4. Performing Actions with `ax`

*   **`AXPress`:** The "Send message" button supports the `AXPress` action. This can be reliably triggered using the `perform` command with the locator described above.
*   **`AXActionNames` Attribute:** While `AXPress` works, the `AXActionNames` attribute might appear as `null` or "Not available" in the JSON output from `getElementAttributes` in the `ax` tool for some buttons. However, the `ax` tool's `search` (with `requireAction`) and `perform` functions correctly determine if an action is supported and can execute it.

### 5. General Observations & Debugging Tips

*   **Electron App:** The UI structure suggests an Electron application. This means standard AppKit/Cocoa control identification via simple AppleScript can be challenging, and accessibility often relies on traversing web areas.
*   **`ax` Tool Debugging:**
    *   Enable `debug_logging: true` in your `ax` commands.
    *   The `stderr` output from `ax` provides detailed traversal and matching information.
    *   The version 1.1.5+ of `ax` has improved debug logging conciseness, printing a version header once per command and indenting subsequent logs.
*   **Focus:** Ensuring the application and target window are active and frontmost is crucial, especially before sending keystrokes. The AppleScript snippets include `activate` and attempts to set `frontmost to true`.
*   **`pathHint`:** Using `pathHint: ["window[1]"]` as a starting point for `ax` queries helps narrow down the search scope significantly.

This summary should provide a good foundation for further automation of the Claude desktop application.
