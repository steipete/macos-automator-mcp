// AXUtils.swift - Contains utility functions for accessibility interactions

import Foundation
import ApplicationServices
import AppKit // For NSRunningApplication, NSWorkspace
import CoreGraphics // For CGPoint, CGSize etc.

// Constants like kAXWindowsAttribute are assumed to be globally available from AXConstants.swift
// debug() is assumed to be globally available from AXLogging.swift
// axValue<T>() is now in AXValueHelpers.swift

// The file should be empty now except for comments and imports if all functions were moved.
// If getElementAttributes and other core AX interaction functions are still here, they will remain.
