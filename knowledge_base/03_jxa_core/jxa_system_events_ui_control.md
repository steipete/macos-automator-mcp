# System Events and UI Control with JXA

JavaScript for Automation (JXA) provides powerful capabilities to control user interface elements, send keystrokes, and interact with menu items through the System Events application. This document provides an overview of UI automation techniques using JXA.

## Available Scripts

The following scripts provide detailed functionality for working with System Events:

1. [Keyboard Input](system_events/jxa_keystrokes.md) - Sending keystrokes and key combinations to applications
2. [Menu Control](system_events/jxa_application_menu_control.md) - Working with application menus and menu items
3. [UI Elements Control](system_events/jxa_ui_elements_control.md) - Interacting with buttons, fields, and other UI elements
4. [System Functions Control](system_events/jxa_system_functions_control.md) - Controlling system-wide functionality like screen saver and menu bar

## Prerequisites

For all System Events operations, you need to grant accessibility permissions to your script's host application (Script Editor, Terminal, etc.) in System Settings → Privacy & Security → Accessibility.

Basic setup for System Events:

```javascript
const systemEvents = Application('System Events');

// Helper function to activate an app before sending input
function activateApp(appName) {
  const app = Application(appName);
  app.activate();
  delay(0.2); // Small delay to ensure app is ready
  return app;
}
```

## General Usage

Each script provides specialized functionality and can be used independently or in combination. Refer to the individual script documentation for detailed usage instructions and examples.

## Important Considerations

- UI elements and structures may change across macOS versions
- Add appropriate delays when interacting with UI elements
- Use descriptive properties when identifying UI elements
- Handle errors gracefully when UI elements cannot be found
- Be cautious when automating system-level functions

System Events provides a powerful way to control macOS applications and interface elements, but it should be used carefully to ensure scripts remain reliable across system updates.
