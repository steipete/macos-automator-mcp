This category contains scripts for working with files, folders, and the macOS Finder. It covers both Finder-dependent operations (like getting selected items) and direct file system operations that don't require Finder (like reading and writing files). Scripts in this category also handle path conversions between different macOS path formats and file selection dialogs.
