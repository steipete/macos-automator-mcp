# Send Text to Ghostty Without Executing

This script allows you to send text to a Ghostty terminal window without automatically executing it, giving you the opportunity to review or edit the command before pressing Enter/Return.

```applescript
on run {input, parameters}
    set textToSend to "--MCP_INPUT:text"
    set executeCommand to "--MCP_INPUT:executeCommand"
    
    -- Validate and set defaults for parameters
    if textToSend is "" or textToSend is missing value then
        return "Error: No text provided to send to Ghostty."
    end if
    
    if executeCommand is "" or executeCommand is missing value then
        set executeCommand to false
    else
        try
            set executeCommand to executeCommand as boolean
        on error
            set executeCommand to false
        end try
    end if
    
    -- Check if Ghostty is installed and running
    try
        tell application "System Events"
            set ghosttyRunning to exists process "Ghostty"
        end tell
        
        if not ghosttyRunning then
            tell application "Ghostty" to activate
            delay 1 -- Give Ghostty time to start up
        end if
    on error
        return "Error: Ghostty terminal application is not installed or cannot be started."
    end try
    
    -- Process multi-line text for sending
    set processedText to my processTextForTerminal(textToSend)
    
    -- Send the text to Ghostty using System Events
    tell application "System Events"
        tell process "Ghostty"
            set frontmost to true
            delay 0.3 -- Give window time to activate
            
            -- Send the text
            keystroke processedText
            
            -- Optionally press Return/Enter to execute the command
            if executeCommand then
                keystroke return
                return "Text sent to Ghostty and executed: " & textToSend
            else
                return "Text sent to Ghostty without execution: " & textToSend
            end if
        end tell
    end tell
end run

-- Helper function to process special characters in text for terminal input
on processTextForTerminal(inputText)
    -- For System Events keystroke, text is sent as-is including newlines
    -- No special processing needed, but this function allows for customization
    return inputText
end processTextForTerminal
```

## Using Text Input Automation with Ghostty

Ghostty is a modern GPU-accelerated terminal emulator for macOS that offers excellent performance and a clean user interface. This script helps you automate text input to Ghostty without immediately executing commands.

### Key Features

1. **Text Without Execution**: Sends text to the terminal without pressing Enter/Return
2. **Optional Execution**: Can automatically execute the command if desired
3. **Works with Multi-line Text**: Properly handles multi-line input for scripts or complex commands
4. **UI Automation**: Uses System Events to interact with the Ghostty UI

### Common Use Cases

#### 1. Complex Command Preparation

When working with complex commands that have multiple flags and options, it's helpful to:
- Send the command template to the terminal
- Make adjustments as needed
- Execute only when ready

#### 2. Interactive CLI Tools

Many command-line tools require multiple inputs or have interactive modes:
- Database clients (MySQL, PostgreSQL)
- Configuration wizards (npm init, create-react-app)
- REPL environments (Python, Node.js)

#### 3. Scripting and Automation

For DevOps and automation workflows:
- Prepare complex sequences of commands
- Allow for human verification before execution
- Create semi-automated workflows with pauses for human input

### Accessibility Permissions

For this script to work properly:

1. Ghostty must be granted Accessibility permissions
2. The application running this script (or the MCP server) must have Accessibility permissions
3. "Secure Input" must not be active when automating keyboard entry

To grant Accessibility permissions:
1. Open System Settings > Privacy & Security > Accessibility
2. Add Ghostty and the scripting application to the list of allowed apps

### Handling Special Characters

The `processTextForTerminal` function can be extended to handle special characters or perform text transformations:

```applescript
on processTextForTerminal(inputText)
    -- Example: Replace tab characters with spaces for better compatibility
    set processedText to my replaceText(inputText, tab, "    ")
    
    -- Example: Escape special characters if needed
    -- set processedText to my replaceText(processedText, "$", "\\$")
    
    return processedText
end processTextForTerminal

on replaceText(theText, oldItem, newItem)
    set AppleScript's text item delimiters to oldItem
    set theTextItems to text items of theText
    set AppleScript's text item delimiters to newItem
    set theText to theTextItems as text
    set AppleScript's text item delimiters to ""
    return theText
end replaceText
```

### Multi-Window Support

As Ghostty supports multiple windows, this script focuses on the frontmost window. To target specific windows by title or other attributes, you would need to extend the script:

```applescript
-- Example extension to find a specific Ghostty window by title
tell application "System Events"
    tell process "Ghostty"
        repeat with w in windows
            if title of w contains "specific-title" then
                set frontmost of w to true
                delay 0.3
                -- Then continue with keystroke commands
                exit repeat
            end if
        end repeat
    end tell
end tell
```

### Clipboard-Based Alternative

For very large text blocks, an alternative approach is to use the clipboard:

```applescript
-- Alternative method using clipboard for large text blocks
set previous_clipboard to the clipboard
set the clipboard to textToSend

tell application "System Events"
    tell process "Ghostty"
        keystroke "v" using {command down}
    end tell
end tell

-- Restore previous clipboard content
delay 0.5
set the clipboard to previous_clipboard
```
