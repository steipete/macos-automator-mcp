# iTerm2 Window and Tab Arrangement

This script arranges iTerm2 windows according to various layout patterns, helping you organize your terminal workspace efficiently and consistently.

```applescript
on run {input, parameters}
    set layout to "--MCP_INPUT:layout"
    set gridRows to "--MCP_INPUT:gridRows"
    set gridColumns to "--MCP_INPUT:gridColumns"
    set positions to "--MCP_INPUT:positions"
    
    -- Validate and set defaults for parameters
    if layout is "" or layout is missing value then
        set layout to "grid"
    end if
    
    -- Convert layout to lowercase for case-insensitive comparison
    set layout to my toLowerCase(layout)
    
    -- Set defaults for grid dimensions
    if gridRows is "" or gridRows is missing value then

## Window Arrangements for iTerm2

Organizing your iTerm2 windows can significantly improve your workflow productivity, especially when working with multiple terminal sessions. This script provides several layout options to help you arrange iTerm2 windows efficiently.

### Layout Options

#### 1. Grid Layout

The grid layout organizes windows in a structured matrix pattern:

- Divides the screen into equal cells based on specified rows and columns
- Provides balanced visibility for all windows
- Ideal for comparing output or running related processes

**Example Use Case**: Development environment with API server, database, frontend, and logs windows arranged in a 2Ã—2 grid.

#### 2. Cascade Layout

The cascade layout arranges windows in a staggered pattern:

- Each window is offset slightly from the previous
- Shows window titles and makes each window accessible
- Creates a visual hierarchy

**Example Use Case**: Multiple SSH sessions to different servers where you need to quickly identify and access each connection.

#### 3. Horizontal Layout

The horizontal layout arranges windows side by side across the screen:

- Maximizes horizontal screen space usage
- Perfect for wide or ultrawide monitors
- Good for comparing output between terminal sessions

**Example Use Case**: Running parallel tasks where you need to monitor output simultaneously, such as watching logs while running tests.

#### 4. Vertical Layout

The vertical layout stacks windows from top to bottom:

- Each window gets full screen width
- Good for tall or portrait-oriented screens
- Ideal for reading long command outputs

**Example Use Case**: Monitoring log files or executing commands that produce lengthy vertical output.

#### 5. Custom Layout

The custom layout provides precise control over window positioning:

- Specify exact coordinates and dimensions for each window
- Create asymmetrical layouts for different-priority tasks
- Position windows across multiple monitors

**Example Use Case**: Complex setups where some windows need more screen real estate than others.

### Multi-Monitor Considerations

When working with multiple monitors, the custom layout option is particularly useful:

1. **Spanning Displays**: Position windows across different screens
2. **Monitor-Specific Layouts**: Place specific windows on specific monitors
3. **Mixed-Use Setup**: Arrange windows based on monitor characteristics (size, orientation)

To determine screen coordinates for multi-monitor setups:

```applescript
on getMultiScreenInfo()
    tell application "System Events"
        set screenInfo to {}
        
        repeat with i from 1 to (count of desktops)
            set screenBounds to bounds of desktop i
            set end of screenInfo to {index:i, bounds:screenBounds}
        end repeat
        
        return screenInfo
    end tell
end getMultiScreenInfo
```

### Integration with iTerm2 Features

This window arrangement script works particularly well with other iTerm2 features:

#### Profile Integration

Assign different profiles to windows based on their position in your layout:

```applescript
tell application "iTerm2"
    tell window 1
        set current session to (create tab with profile "Production")
    end tell
    tell window 2
        set current session to (create tab with profile "Development")
    end tell
end tell
```

#### Window Naming

Add descriptive names to windows based on their function in your layout:

```applescript
tell application "iTerm2"
    tell window 1
        set name to "Server Monitor"
    end tell
    tell window 2
        set name to "Database"
    end tell
end tell
```

#### Session Saving

After arranging windows, save the arrangement using iTerm2's built-in functionality:

1. Create the perfect layout using this script
2. Save the window arrangement using the `Save Window Arrangement` command
3. Restore it later when needed

### Example Arrangements

#### Development Grid

```json
{
  "layout": "grid",
  "gridRows": 2,
  "gridColumns": 2
}
```

This creates a 2Ã—2 grid suitable for:
- Top-left: API server
- Top-right: Database console
- Bottom-left: File editing
- Bottom-right: Build/test output

#### DevOps Horizontal Layout

```json
{
  "layout": "horizontal"
}
```

This creates a side-by-side arrangement for:
- Left: Production server monitoring
- Middle: Staging environment
- Right: Deployment scripts

#### Custom Multi-Monitor Setup

```json
{
  "layout": "custom",
  "positions": [
    {"x": 100, "y": 100, "width": 1000, "height": 800},  // Primary monitor
    {"x": 2020, "y": 100, "width": 1000, "height": 400}, // Secondary top
    {"x": 2020, "y": 550, "width": 1000, "height": 400}  // Secondary bottom
  ]
}
```

This creates a three-window setup spanning two monitors with a larger window on the primary display and two smaller windows on the secondary display.

### Advanced Customization

The script can be extended to support:

1. **Preset Layouts**: Create named presets for common tasks
2. **Auto-Execute Commands**: Run specific commands in each window after arrangement
3. **Profile Assignment**: Apply specific profiles based on window position
4. **Session Grouping**: Group windows by project or function

Example extension for auto-executing commands:

```applescript
on arrangeWithCommands(layout, commands)
    -- First arrange the windows using the standard function
    my arrangeInGrid(2, 2, 1440, 900)
    
    -- Then execute the commands in each window
    tell application "iTerm2"
        repeat with i from 1 to (count of commands)
            if i â‰¤ (count of windows) then
                tell window i
                    tell current session
                        write text (item i of commands)
                    end tell
                end tell
            end if
        end repeat
    end tell
end arrangeWithCommands
```
