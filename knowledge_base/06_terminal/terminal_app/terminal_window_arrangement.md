This script arranges Terminal.app windows according to various layout patterns, helping you organize your workspace efficiently. It can arrange existing windows or create new ones in the desired configuration.

**Features:**
- Arrange windows in a grid pattern (rows and columns)
- Cascade windows diagonally across the screen
- Arrange windows horizontally (side by side)
- Arrange windows vertically (stacked)
- Apply custom window positions and sizes
- Works with existing windows or creates new ones as needed

## Terminal Window Arrangement

Organizing your terminal windows effectively can significantly improve your productivity, especially when working with multiple sessions simultaneously. This script provides several layout options to help you arrange Terminal.app windows in a way that suits your workflow.

### Arrangement Patterns

#### Grid Layout

The grid layout arranges windows in rows and columns, creating a structured view of multiple terminal sessions:

- Perfect for monitoring multiple systems or processes simultaneously
- Provides equal visibility to all windows
- Customizable number of rows and columns

When to use:
- Server monitoring across multiple systems
- Running and viewing multiple processes side by side
- Comparing output from different commands

#### Cascade Layout

The cascade layout arranges windows in a diagonal pattern, with each window slightly offset from the previous one:

- Shows window titles for all windows simultaneously
- Allows quick access to any window by clicking its visible portion
- Creates a natural visual hierarchy

When to use:
- When you need to switch frequently between several windows
- When window titles are important for identification
- For workflows where one window might be primary but others need to remain accessible

#### Horizontal Layout

The horizontal layout arranges windows side by side across the screen:

- Maximizes horizontal space utilization
- Ideal for wide-screen monitors
- Perfect for comparing output across windows

When to use:
- Code comparison across different files or versions
- Log file monitoring with different log sources
- Command execution with side-by-side results

#### Vertical Layout

The vertical layout stacks windows from top to bottom:

- Works well on taller screens
- Each window gets full width of the screen
- Great for reading long output or logs

When to use:
- Reading through long command outputs
- Working with log files or text-heavy content
- When vertical space is more valuable than horizontal

#### Custom Layout

The custom layout allows precise control over window positions and sizes:

- Specify exact coordinates and dimensions for each window
- Create any arrangement pattern you can imagine
- Accommodate specific workflow requirements

When to use:
- Complex workflows with specific window placement needs
- When you want to save and reuse specific window arrangements
- When standard patterns don't fit your needs

### Working with Multi-Monitor Setups

When working with multiple monitors, you can use custom layouts to distribute windows across screens:

1. Determine the coordinates of your screens using System Information
2. Create custom positions that span your monitor setup
3. Apply the custom layout to spread windows across all available screens

For example, to span two side-by-side monitors:

```json
{
  "layout": "custom",
  "positions": [
    {"x": 50, "y": 50, "width": 800, "height": 600},
    {"x": 1970, "y": 50, "width": 800, "height": 600}
  ]
}
```

### Integration with Other Scripts

This window arrangement script works well in combination with other Terminal management scripts:

1. **Session Management**: Arrange windows, then save the arrangement for later restoration
2. **Title Management**: Set window titles based on their position in the arrangement
3. **Split Pane Management**: Arrange windows first, then create split panes within them

### Example Use Cases

#### Development Environment

```json
{
  "layout": "grid",
  "gridRows": 2,
  "gridColumns": 2
}
```

Create a 2Ã—2 grid with:
- Top-left: Code editing
- Top-right: Server/application output
- Bottom-left: Git commands
- Bottom-right: Build/test output

#### System Monitoring

```json
{
  "layout": "horizontal"
}
```

Create side-by-side windows for:
- CPU/memory monitoring (htop)
- Network traffic
- Disk I/O
- Log file tailing

#### Custom Workspace

```json
{
  "layout": "custom",
  "positions": [
    {"x": 0, "y": 0, "width": 1200, "height": 800},
    {"x": 1220, "y": 0, "width": 700, "height": 400},
    {"x": 1220, "y": 420, "width": 700, "height": 400}
  ]
}
```

Create a primary window on the left and two smaller windows stacked on the right.
