This subcategory contains scripts for automating Sublime Text, a powerful and customizable text editor popular among developers. The scripts provide functionality for common operations such as opening files and folders, manipulating text, managing projects, and working with Package Control. These automations help streamline workflows by allowing direct interaction with Sublime Text from AppleScript.

The scripts in this category include:

1. Opening files and folders in Sublime Text
2. Retrieving content from the current document or selection
3. Executing commands via the command palette or keyboard shortcuts
4. Managing Sublime Text projects (create, open, switch)
5. Manipulating text with various transformations
6. Managing packages through Package Control

These automations can be particularly useful for integrating Sublime Text into larger workflows or creating custom hotkeys for frequent actions.
