This script:
1. Moves currently selected messages in Mail.app to a specified mailbox
2. Can target a mailbox in a specific account or search across all accounts
3. Reports how many messages were successfully moved
4. Provides helpful error messages if the account or mailbox isn't found
5. Continues processing even if some messages can't be moved
