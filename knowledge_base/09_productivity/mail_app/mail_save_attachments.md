This script:
1. Extracts all attachments from currently selected emails in Mail.app
2. Saves them to the specified location (or Desktop by default)
3. Creates subfolders based on email subjects when multiple messages are selected
4. Sanitizes filenames to ensure they're valid for the filesystem
5. Returns detailed information about the saved attachments
