This category contains scripts for working with GarageBand, Apple's entry-level digital audio workstation (DAW) for macOS. GarageBand provides easy-to-use tools for recording, editing, and producing music. Like Logic Pro, GarageBand has limited AppleScript support, so these scripts use a combination of available AppleScript commands and UI automation to control various aspects of the application.
