  Access and control GarageBand's Smart Controls interface for adjusting effects
  and parameters on instrument and audio tracks.
keywords:
  - GarageBand
  - smart controls
  - effects
  - mixing
  - instrument
  - parameters
  - music production
language: applescript
parameters: >
  - track_name (optional): Name of the track to select for controlling (if
  empty, uses currently selected track)
notes: >
  - GarageBand must be running with a project open.

  - Smart Controls allow access to the most important effect parameters for each
  track.

  - This script uses UI automation to navigate to and toggle Smart Controls.

  - Due to UI variations between GarageBand versions, some operations may need
  adjustment.

  - The script demonstrates several basic Smart Controls operations but cannot
  access all parameters reliably.

  - This script requires Accessibility permissions to be granted for the script
  runner.

Access and control GarageBand's Smart Controls interface.
