title: "Keynote: Set Title and Body Text of Current Slide"
category: "08_creative_and_document_apps"
id: keynote_set_slide_text
description: "Sets the title and body text content of the current slide in the frontmost Keynote presentation."
keywords: ["Keynote", "slide text", "title", "body", "content", "text item", "presentation"]
language: applescript
isComplex: true
argumentsPrompt: "Title text as 'titleText' and body text as 'bodyText' for the current slide in inputData. Assumes a presentation is open and has a slide selected."
notes: |
  - A Keynote presentation must be open and a slide selected.
  - This script attempts to set the object text of the slide's placeholder text items for title and body.
  - This relies on the current slide having conventional placeholder items for title and body. If the master slide is blank or uses non-standard placeholders, this may not work as expected.
  - Requires Automation permission for Keynote.app.
