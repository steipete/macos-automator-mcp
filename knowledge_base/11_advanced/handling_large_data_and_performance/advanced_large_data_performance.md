notes: >
  - AppleScript can be slow with very large data sets or deeply nested loops.

  - Offloading to shell scripts or JXA (with JavaScript's native speed) can
  help.

  - Minimize interactions within `tell application` blocks if an app is slow to
  respond.

Strategies for improving AppleScript performance with large data:

1.  **Minimize Loops over App Objects:** Instead of `repeat with anItem in every item of folder X`, try to get properties in bulk if the app supports it: `get name of every item of folder X`.
2.  **Reference vs. Copy:** Understand `set x to y` (reference for lists/records) vs. `set x to a reference to y` vs. `copy y to x` (deep copy for lists/records). Unnecessary copying of large lists is slow.
3.  **Text Item Delimiters for String Processing:** For complex string manipulation (splitting, joining many parts), `text item delimiters` is usually faster than repeated concatenation or character-by-character loops.
4.  **`do shell script` for Heavy Lifting:** Shell commands (`awk`, `sed`, `grep`, Python/Perl scripts) are often much faster for text processing or complex file operations.
5.  **Batching Operations:** If sending many commands to an app, see if the app supports batch operations (e.g., deleting multiple files with one `delete {alias1, alias2}` command vs. a loop).
6.  **System Events for UI:** While powerful, UI scripting is inherently slower than direct dictionary commands. Use sparingly and efficiently. `delay` statements should be minimal but sufficient.
7.  **JXA for Performance:** JavaScript engines are generally faster for raw computation and string/array manipulation than AppleScript's interpreter. Consider JXA for performance-critical sections if possible.

```applescript
-- Example: Efficiently getting names from Finder (bulk vs. loop)

--MCP_INPUT:targetFolderAlias

on getFinderItemNames(folderAlias)
  if folderAlias is missing value then
    try
      set folderAlias to (choose folder with prompt "Select a folder for performance test:")
    on error
      return "User cancelled folder selection."
    end try
  end if
  
  set results to ""
  
  -- Potentially SLOW for very large folders:
  set startTimeSlow to current date
  set itemNamesSlow to {}
  tell application "Finder"
    try
      set allItems to items of folderAlias
      repeat with anItem in allItems
        set end of itemNamesSlow to name of anItem
      end repeat
      set timeTakenSlow to (current date) - startTimeSlow
      set results to results & "Slow method (looping) item count: " & (count of itemNamesSlow) & ", time: " & timeTakenSlow & " seconds.\n"
    on error errMsg
      set results to results & "Error in slow method: " & errMsg & "\n"
    end try
  end tell
  
  -- Generally FASTER for very large folders:
  set startTimeFast to current date
  set itemNamesFast to {}
  tell application "Finder"
    try
      set itemNamesFast to name of items of folderAlias
      set timeTakenFast to (current date) - startTimeFast
      set results to results & "Fast method (bulk get) item count: " & (count of itemNamesFast) & ", time: " & timeTakenFast & " seconds.\n"
    on error errMsg
      set results to results & "Error in fast method: " & errMsg & "\n"
    end try
  end tell
  
  if (count of itemNamesSlow) > 0 and (count of itemNamesSlow) < 20 then
    set results to results & "Slow names: " & itemNamesSlow & "\n"
  end if
  if (count of itemNamesFast) > 0 and (count of itemNamesFast) < 20 then
    set results to results & "Fast names: " & itemNamesFast & "\n"
  end if
  
  return results
end getFinderItemNames

return my getFinderItemNames(missing value) -- Pass missing value or a pre-defined alias for testing

-- To use with MCP_INPUT:targetFolderAlias (which would be a POSIX path string)
(*
set mcpFolderAlias to missing value
set mcpInputPath to "--MCP_INPUT:targetFolderAlias"
if mcpInputPath is not missing value and mcpInputPath is not "" and mcpInputPath is not "--MCP_INPUT:targetFolderAlias" then
  try
    set mcpFolderAlias to POSIX file mcpInputPath as alias
  on error
     return "Error: MCP_INPUT:targetFolderAlias is not a valid path: " & mcpInputPath
  end try
else
  return "Error: MCP_INPUT:targetFolderAlias not provided or is placeholder."
end if
return my getFinderItemNames(mcpFolderAlias)
*)
```
