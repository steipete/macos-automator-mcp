-- Generate productivity report
generateProductivityReport("2024-05-01", "2024-05-15")

-- Clean up completed tasks
cleanupCompletedTasks(30)
```

## Script Details

This script automates the review process in Things to ensure consistent task management.

```applescript
-- Automated review system for Things

- Things 3 must be installed on the system.
- This script automates the review process in Things following GTD principles.
- Functions:
  - `runDailyReview`: Creates or updates a daily review to-do with task summaries
  - `runWeeklyReview`: Creates or updates a weekly review to-do with project status
  - `generateProductivityReport`: Creates a detailed report of completed tasks with graphs
  - `cleanupCompletedTasks`: Archives old completed tasks to reduce clutter
- The daily review includes:
  - Summary of today's tasks and completion status
  - List of overdue tasks
  - Inbox item summary
  - Review checklist
- The weekly review includes:
  - Project status overview with progress percentages
  - Upcoming deadlines
  - Stalled projects (projects with no active to-dos)
  - Weekly review checklist
  - Reflection prompts
- The productivity report includes:
  - Daily breakdown with simple bar graphs
  - Project completion analysis
  - Tag analysis
- This script helps maintain an organized system and provides insights into productivity patterns.
- Consider scheduling these reviews to run automatically using macOS's Calendar app or Automator.
