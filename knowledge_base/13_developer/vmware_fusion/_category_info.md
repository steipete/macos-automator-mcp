description: Scripts for controlling and automating VMware Fusion virtual machines on macOS
---

This category contains scripts and utilities for automating VMware Fusion virtual machines on macOS. These scripts demonstrate how to:

- List all available virtual machines
- Start/stop/suspend virtual machines
- Check virtual machine status
- Perform other VM management operations

The scripts use a combination of direct AppleScript commands when available through VMware's dictionary, and UI scripting as fallback methods for operations not directly supported.

Many operations require appropriate permissions in macOS:
- Automation permissions for controlling VMware Fusion
- Accessibility permissions for UI scripting via System Events
