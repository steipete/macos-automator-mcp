# Open the Weather App on macOS

This script opens the macOS Weather app, which is available on macOS Ventura and later versions. If the app is already running, it will bring it to the foreground.

```applescript
-- Script to open the Weather app on macOS (Ventura and later)

-- Check if we're on macOS Ventura or later (macOS 13+)
set osVersion to system version of (system info)
set majorVersion to first word of osVersion

if majorVersion < 13 then
    return "Error: The Weather app is only available on macOS Ventura (macOS 13) and later. Your current OS version is " & osVersion & "."
end if

-- Try to launch the Weather app
try
    tell application "Weather"
        activate
        return "Weather app opened successfully."
    end tell
on error errMsg
    -- If app cannot be launched, return error
    return "Error: Could not open the Weather app. " & errMsg
end try
```

## Example Usage

### Open the Weather App
```applescript
-- Execute the script to open the Weather app
```

## Notes

1. The Weather app was introduced in macOS Ventura (macOS 13), so this script checks the macOS version and provides an error message if run on an earlier version.

2. If the Weather app is already running, this script will bring it to the foreground.

3. The script handles errors that might occur when trying to open the app (such as if the app has been removed).

4. This script provides a simple way to launch the Weather app as part of a larger automation workflow.
