title: 'Xcode: Build Project via xcodebuild Shell Command'
category: 13_developer/xcode_app
id: xcode_build_project_shell
description: Builds an Xcode project or workspace using the 'xcodebuild' command-line tool.
keywords:
  - Xcode
  - build
  - compile
  - xcodebuild
  - shell
  - developer
language: applescript
isComplex: true
argumentsPrompt: >-
  Absolute POSIX path to .xcodeproj or .xcworkspace as 'projectPath', and scheme
  name as 'schemeName' in inputData. Optionally, configuration (e.g., 'Debug',
  'Release') as 'configName'.
notes: >
  - This method is generally more reliable than UI scripting Xcode for builds.

  - The output of `xcodebuild` is returned, which can be extensive.

  - Ensure `xcodebuild` command-line tools are installed and configured
  (`xcode-select -p`).
